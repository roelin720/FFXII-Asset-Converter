# FFXII Asset Converter

A tool to convert most FFXII models and textures to and from common formats.
With this tool, it can now be possible to create HD character textures and completely reshape any model.
You will need a separate VBF browser program in order to extract and inject the assets from/to FFXII's VBF.

Compile via visual studio only on windows.

The GUI code is currently just slapped together. I'll clean it up soon.
